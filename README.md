**Modules :** ```math``` , ```random```, ```pyxel``` - (pyxel version 1.4.1)

## How to play ?
1. Install Python 3
2. Install Pyxel Module - [link](https://pypi.org/project/pyxel/)
3. Copy or clone this repo

## Steering
* `Arrows` - to move around
* `Space` - to shoot blaster
* ` Q ` - to quit
* `Alt + Enter` - Fullscreen
* `Alt + 1` - Screenshot

## Strategy Tips
* you start with 1 lvl shield,  remember you can't gather more than 5 
* you start with one blaster superpower and it is the hardest to draw (only 10% chance), use it wisely
* try to eliminate especially smaller balls, they are more dangerous, cause of the speed
* if you gather max shield lvl, try to eliminate the quickest moving ball, by collision
* try to combine freeze with blaster to eliminate as much balls as possible 
* superpower packages can be destroyed by balls, so try to collect them as soon as possible, to do that I recommend staying close to the center
* the less balls the faster they appear

## Things to do
* [ ] maybe some cool graphics instead of squares and circles
* [ ] add some music
* [ ] balls should not appear anywhere near the player
* [ ] maybe some reset key
* [ ] more superpowers ?
